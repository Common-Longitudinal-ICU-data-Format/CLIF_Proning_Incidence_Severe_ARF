#Multi-center Evaluation of Prone Positioning Practices for Severe Respiratory Failure

## Objective

Evaluate the Incidence of Prone Positioning for Patients with Severe Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure Over Time Using the Common Longitudinal ICU Format (CLIF)

## Required CLIF tables and fields

Please refer to the online [CLIF data dictionary](https://clif-consortium.github.io/website/data-dictionary/data-dictionary-2.0.0.html), [ETL tools](https://clif-consortium.github.io/website/tools.html), and [specific table contacts](https://github.com/clif-consortium/CLIF?tab=readme-ov-file#relational-clif) for more information on constructing the required tables and fields.


The following tables are required:
1. **patient**: `patient_id`, `race_category`, `ethnicity_category`, `sex_category`
2. **hospitalization**: `patient_id`, `hospitalization_id`, `admission_dttm`, `discharge_dttm`, `age_at_admission`
3. **adt**: `patient_id`, `hospitalization_id`, `hospital_id`, `location_category`, `in_dttm`
3. **vitals**: `hospitalization_id`, `recorded_dttm`, `vital_category`, `vital_value`
   - `vital_category` = 'height_cm', 'weight_kg', 'map'
4. **labs**: `hospitalization_id`, `lab_result_dttm`, `lab_category`, `lab_value`
   - `lab_category` = 'po2_arterial', 'creatinine', 'bilirubin'
5. **medication_admin_continuous**: `hospitalization_id`, `admin_dttm`, `med_name`, `med_category`, `med_dose`, `med_dose_unit`
   - `med_category` = "norepinephrine", "epinephrine", "phenylephrine", "vasopressin", "dopamine", "angiotensin", "cisatracurium"
6. **respiratory_support**: `hospitalization_id`, `recorded_dttm`, `device_category`, `mode_category`, `tracheostomy`, `fio2_set`, `peep_set`
7. **position**: `hospitalization_id`, `recorded_dttm`, `position_category`
8. **microbiology_nonculture**:'patient_id', and sars_cov2 tests
9. **patient_assessments**:'hospitalization_id', 'rass'


## Cohort identification
Inclusion Criteria: 
1)	Adults (> 18 years) with moderate-severe hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) between 2018-2024
   (NOTE: Not all sites may have full range of data, but will use the years of each database)

2)	Patient meets PROSEVA criteria for proning defined as: 
a.	P/F <= 150 on PEEP >= 5 and FiO2 >= 0.6 (uses ABG measurements only, no imputation)
b.	Criteria are met in the first 36 hours of IMV initiation (t_PROSEVA_first)
      AND
i.	Confirmed on second qualifying blood gas in a 12-hour window beginning 12 hours after the first eligible blood gas (t_proseva_first + 12 hours > t_proseva_second < t_proseva_first + 24 hours)
                   OR
ii.	Patient is proned within 24 hours of initial qualifying blood gas (t_PROSEVA_first < t_proning < t_PROSEVA_first + 24 hours)

4)	For patients meeting the above inclusions, time of enrollment (t_enrollment) is the earlier of time of second qualifying PROSEVA ABG OR time of proning (if patient proned prior to meeting criteria second time). 


Exclusion Criteria: 
1)	Mechanical ventilation initiated at outside hospital:
a.	Operationalization: 
i. If a patient’s first ADT observation is not the ED (location_category!=’ED’) AND first device_category==’IMV’ exclude
2)	Tracheostomy recorded prior to completing first 24 hours of the first episode of mechanical ventilation (includes tracheostomy on admission)
3)	In the operating room in the 48 hours prior to meeting enrollment criteria
4)	For patients with more than 1 eligible encounter within a given CLIF consortium system, 1 eligible encounter per patient will be randomly selected and included

## Expected Results

1. Will output cohort size intermittently to ultimately aggregate across sites to develop federation-wide consort diagram. 
2. Will output pf_table.csv table with pf ratio summary statistics. 
3. Will output prone_outcomes.csv table that includes site-specific aggregate proning cohort data per month.
4. Will output results of regression models, for use in aggregative cross-federation analysis.  

## Detailed Instructions for running the project

## 1. Setup Project Environment
All Packages are coded into the cohort_identification and analysis scripts and can be run in RStudio (developed using R version 4.3.1). 

## 2. For local sites there are 2 initial scripts to run
Can run both scripts as R markdown files with the 'knit' function in R
1. Run local cohort identification script: 00_local_CLIF_prone_incidence_cohort_identification_wCOVID.Rmd script to define the ARF cohort. 
2. Run local analysis script: local analysis script: 01_local_CLIF_prone_incidence_analysis_wCOVID.Rmd to perform analysis and generate output. 

## 3. Upload summary results from the project_output (tables and graphs) to the UChicago Box Folder. 

## 4. Once all participating sites hvae rund scripts 00 and 01, lead investigators generate global coefficients for proning covariates. THEN will ask that each site run a third script to generate risk-adjusted rates of proning by hospital and period. 
3. Run local proning prediction script with globaly estimated coefficients: 02_local_CLIF_prone_incidence_global_risk_adjustment.Rmd

## 4. Lead Investigators than Run Analytic Scripts to Accomplish Exploratory Data analysis, summary random effects meta-analysis and bayesian hierarchical models. 
1. 03_summary_CLIF_prone_incidence_allsite_eda.Rmd (generates data for Tables 1 and 2, Figure 1)
2. 04_summary_CLIF_proning_meta_analysis.R
3. 05_summary_CLIF_prone_incidence_bayesian_hierarchical.Rmd (generates data for Figure 3)
