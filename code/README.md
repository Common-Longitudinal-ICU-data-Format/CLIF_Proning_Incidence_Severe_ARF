 ## Code directory

This directory contains scripts for the project workflow. 
Scripts are run in order and labeled as scripts that are to be run locally (within each participating CLIF institution) and those that are run with summary data by the lead investigators to pool data for analysis. 

See READ Me file in main branch for details.
